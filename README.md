# Time2Feat: Learning Interpretable Representations for Multivariate Time Series Clustering

Time2Feat is an end-to-end machine learning system for multivariate time series clustering. The system is the first to
leverage both inter-signal and intra-signal features of the time series. While relying on state-of-the-art feature
extraction approaches allows to further refine the features by choosing the most appropriate ones and incorporating
human feedback in the feature selection process

## Installation

**time2feat** was tested on Python 3.7 on Linux amd Windows machines. It is recommended to use a virtual environment (
See: [python3 venv doc](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)).

Clone the project into local and install **time2feat** package:

```bash
// Virtual environment creation
$ cd source
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate

// Dependecy installation
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

Get started with **time2feat**

```python
import numpy as np
from time2feat.extraction.extractor import feature_extraction
from time2feat.utils.importance_old import feature_selection
from time2feat.model.clustering import ClusterWrapper

# 10 multivariate time series with 100 timestamps and 3 signals each
arr = np.random.randn(10, 100, 3)
arr[5:] = arr[5:] * 100

labels = {}  # unsupervised mode
# labels = {0: 'a', 1: 'a', 5: 'b', 6: 'b'}  # semi-supervised mode
n_clusters = 2  # Number of clusters

transform_type = 'std'  # preprocessing step
model_type = 'KMeans'  # clustering model

# Feature extraction
df_feats = feature_extraction(arr, batch_size=100, p=1)

# Feature selection
context = {'model_type': model_type, 'transform_type': transform_type}
top_feats = feature_selection(df_feats, labels=labels, context=context)
df_feats = df_feats[top_feats]

# Clustering
model = ClusterWrapper(n_clusters=n_clusters, model_type=model_type, transform_type=transform_type)
y_pred = model.fit_predict(df_feats)
print(y_pred.shape)
```

## Working example

[Demo:](https://github.com/softlab-unimore/time2feat/blob/main/demo.py) a script to apply **time2feat** on UEA & UCR
multivariate time series dataset.

## Dataset

All public multivariate time series datasets used in the paper can be downloaded
from [UEA & UCR Time Series Classification Repository](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/index.php). The demo
code only support sktime formatted ts files (
see [Cricket](https://github.com/softlab-unimore/time2feat/tree/main/data/Cricket) dataset).
